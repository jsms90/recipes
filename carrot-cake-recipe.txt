Carrot cake:

For the cake:
	175ml sunflower iol
	200 muscovado sugar
	3 large eggs
	140g carrots, grated
	175 self-raising flour
	1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
	1.5 tsp ground ginger
	0.5 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
	grated zest of 1 orange
	75g chopped walnuts (a few halved for decoration)

For the icing:
	200g full0fat cream cheese
	50g butter, softened
	85g icing sugar, sifted
	pinch of ground cinammon

Instructions:

Preheat the oven to 180ºC/Gas 4/fan 160ºC. Grease an 18cm cake tin and line it with baking paper.

Put the oil, eggs, and sugar into a large mixing bowl. Whisk until the mixture is well mixed and noticeably thicker. Gently fold in the grated carrots, then stir in the flour, bicarb, spices, and chopped walnuts until evenly blended.

Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 1 hour,, until it feels firm and springy when you press it in the centre, or until a skewer comes out cleanly. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn it out, peel off the paper and let it cool on a wire rack.

To make the icing, beat all ingredients until smooth. Spread over the top of the cake, once it has cooled, and decorate with walnut halves. Only use full-fat cream cheese! Otherwise the icing will be runny, and let's face it, not as delicious!
